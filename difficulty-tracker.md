# Difficulty Progression Tracking Chart

## Instructions
For each level, rate the difficulty on a scale of 1-5 (1 being very easy, 5 being very challenging). Note key factors that contributed to the difficulty rating and any observations about design patterns.

## Difficulty Curve Analysis

After completing both tables, use this data to:

1. Calculate average difficulty per 10-level segment
2. Identify any significant difficulty spikes
3. Note patterns in how each game introduces new challenges
4. Compare the overall difficulty progression between the two games

This will help identify how each game manages player onboarding and retention through difficulty balancing.
