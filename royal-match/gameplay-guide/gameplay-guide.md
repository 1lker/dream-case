## Introduction

Royal Match is a match-3 puzzle game where you complete levels by matching colored items to meet specific targets. As you progress, you'll earn stars to renovate and upgrade areas in the castle, while collecting coins and boosters to enhance your gameplay experience.

## Basic Gameplay

### Objective
- Complete one or more targets displayed in the upper left corner of the gameplay screen
- Clear game elements by matching 3 or more same-colored items
- Use power-ups and boosters strategically to help clear targets
- Complete levels before running out of moves (shown in the upper-right corner)

### Gameplay Flow
1. Match 3+ same-colored items to clear them from the board
2. Create and use power-ups for more effective clearing
3. Complete all targets before running out of moves
4. Earn stars to renovate castle areas
5. Collect coins and boosters from events or tasks

### Failing a Level
If you run out of moves before completing targets, you will:
- Lose one life
- Need to restart the level
- Have the option to purchase additional moves using coins

## Lives System

Lives determine how many attempts you have to beat levels:
- Standard maximum: 5 lives
- Royal Pass holders: 8 lives
- Replenishment rate: 1 life every 30 minutes
- Visibility: Heart-shaped icon on home screen shows current lives

### Team Lives
- Team members can request lives from teammates
- Cannot request lives if you already have more than 10 free lives

## Power-ups

Power-ups are special items created by matching specific patterns of same-colored items. They can be activated by tapping or swapping.

| TNT | Match 5 same-colored items in L or T shape | Clears items within a two-tile radius |
| Light Ball | Match 5 same-colored items in a line | Clears all items of the same color |

| Light Ball + Rocket/TNT/Propeller | Turns the most common colored items into the respective power-up |
| Light Ball + Light Ball | Clears all items on the board and removes one layer from game elements |

## Boosters
