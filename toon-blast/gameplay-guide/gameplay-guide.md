## Basic Gameplay

### Gameplay Flow
1. Identify the level goals (shown at the beginning of each level)
2. Tap matching color cubes to clear them from the board
3. Create special items for more effective clearing
4. Complete all goals before running out of moves
5. Progress to the next level and unlock new content

## Lives System

Lives (represented as hearts) determine how many attempts you have to play levels:
